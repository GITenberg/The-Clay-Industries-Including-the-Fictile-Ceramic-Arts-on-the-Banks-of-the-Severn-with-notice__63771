<b>Alexander H. Brown, Esq., M.P.</b></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>
<p>The following treatise on the &ldquo;Clay Industries&rdquo; of
the Borough you represent may scarcely appear at first sight of
that importance to warrant the usual form of a dedication, and I
confess I cannot but wish, for present purposes, that its merits
were more commensurate with the object.&nbsp; As a large number
of your constituents however are engaged in these various
branches of trade&mdash;in one of which you too have more than a
general interest, and as I have been at some trouble to collect
facts bearing upon their general history, the work itself may not
be without some value.</p>
<p>The motive which dictates the dedication will not, I think, be
misconstrued, <a name="pageiv"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
iv</span>inasmuch as the prominent part I took more than nine
years ago in introducing you to the constituency, as one likely
to become a representative of the &ldquo;Commercial
Element&rdquo; of the Borough, and the highly satisfactory way in
which those predictions have been verified and fulfilled, as well
as the very general regard and esteem all feel who have observed
your public and private character, justify me in feeling a
special pride in the result, and hereby making this public
acknowledgement of services so faithfully and honourably
rendered.</p>
<p>I have the honour to remain,</p>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>

<h2><a name="pagev"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
v</span>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Borough of Wenlock comprises
places not only rich in historic interest but important also as
centres of manufacturing industry; and none more so than those
grouped within a mile or two of the Iron-bridge, itself a work of
world-wide fame.&nbsp; &ldquo;Broseley Pipes&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Broseley Bricks,&rdquo;&mdash;the latter including all
similar productions emanating from Coalbrookdale, the Woodlands,
Lady-Wood, Coleford, &amp;c.&mdash;possess acknowledged merits
which create for them a constant demand, whilst in higher
branches of the art, where similar natural and other clays are
used, Messrs. Maw, Craven, Dunnill, and Co., and Bathurst, find a
still more extensive market for their goods.</p>
<p>From time immemorial the merits of these clays seem to have
been known and recognised; if not from Early British, at any rate
from the period when the armies of imperial Rome penetrated the
Valley of the Severn, through intermediate ages, these beds of
clay which give employment to thousands seem to have been used
for some purpose or other, either for articles of ornament or of
use.&nbsp; At Caersws, near Llandinam, on the left bank of the
Severn, we have seen Roman bricks apparently with the initials of
the workmen&rsquo;s <a name="pagevi"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
vi</span>names upon them; whilst of pottery, cart loads have been
found there and at Wroxeter, including a number of jars, bottles,
urns, lamps, vases, &amp;c., with hunting and other
subjects.&nbsp; Some of the mortars, colanders, dishes, and
similar kitchen utensils, are of coarse white clay, similar to
that now used at Broseley.&nbsp; It is therefore evident from
modern excavations that fifteen hundred years ago the value of
these clays was known to the brick-makers and potters introduced
by that enterprising people.&nbsp; Specimens of Norman and of
later periods are rare, but certain evidences concur to make it
clear that not only fifteen hundred years ago was the worth of
these clays established, but that from that period to the present
they have been used in one way or another.</p>
<p>The subject is therefore one of historical as well as of
industrial interest, although those at present engaged in the
various branches of manufacture may be too absorbed in turning
the material to account to pause to note the stages the trades in
which they are engaged have gone through.</p>
<p>It was the value of these clays which led to the establishment
of works for the manufacture of porcelain at Caughley, Jackfield,
Coalport, and Madeley, historical notices of which works will be
found in the following pages, which are for the most part a
reprint of articles that have appeared in the &ldquo;Salopian and
West-Midland Magazine.&rdquo;</p>

BRICKS &amp; TILES, TESSELATED TILES,<br />
POTTERY, &amp;c.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Clay</span>, as commonly understood, means
earth of sufficient ductility to allow of its being kneaded by
the hand into useful shapes or forms, and ranks as a <i>raw</i>
material, or one not worked up or prepared for use.&nbsp; Some
clays are soft, others are indurated, or hard and rocky: but all
have, nevertheless, been in one sense prepared by poundings,
washings, and mixings, carried on by Nature on a much larger
scale than that on which they are now fitted for use.&nbsp; They
differ in quality, in degree of firmness, and in colour, and show
certain relationships by which it is clear that they are derived
from sand, just as sand is derived from a hardy race of pebbles,
which in turn bear a close relationship to rocks, from which
undoubtedly they are also derived.&nbsp; Surface clays, used for
making inferior bricks and tiles, whose earthy <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>odour gives
evidence of alumina, are often derived from red sandstone rocks,
which have been ground down by machinery of waves or streams;
whilst the deeper coal-measure clunches, used for firebricks and
pottery, were originally the sediment thrown by rivers at their
embouchures into inland lakes or seas.&nbsp; Common red clays,
deriving their colour from iron, have many impurities, and
contain a large percentage of alumina.&nbsp; Fire-clays are
nearly free from iron, and contain a large amount of silica,
whilst china-clay, or <i>kaolin</i>, contains felspar, sometimes
with the impurities of soda and potash.</p>
<p>Let us first take brick and tile Clays.&nbsp; Of the three
substances expressed by the three words of four
letters&mdash;clay, coal, and gold, we question whether the first
does not rank highest in importance.&nbsp; The latter may be the
most coveted, but the former, we imagine, contributes most to the
conveniences and comforts of mankind.&nbsp; It is in one form or
another universally attainable.&nbsp; There is a great difference
in its qualities; and when it is remembered that a porous brick
made from bad clay will hold nearly a quart of water, the
advantage of good clays producing good bricks which will protect
health and property from the injurious effects of a fickle
climate, becomes apparent.&nbsp; In addition to ordinary clays
used for the manufacture of building materials, we have
throughout the whole coalfields of Shropshire and <a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>Staffordshire
superior fire-clays, which occur in a tough indurated state, and
are known by the familiar name of clunches.&nbsp; They possess
but a small portion of iron, which gives a red colour to ordinary
clays, at the same time that they are distinguished by an almost
entire absence of lime and alkalies; yet contain, on the other
hand, that proportion of silica and alumina which although they
cannot be melted by the strongest heat, form ingredients which
during the process of burning combine to form an artificial stone
capable of sustaining great heat.&nbsp; The following is an
analysis of one of these fire-clays:&mdash;</p>

<p>These shales or clunches, now indurated, were originally the
soft soils from which the roots of plants of the coal-measure
period drew their nourishment; and they still retain the
impression of such roots in great abundance, as any one may
satisfy himself who takes a piece in his hand to <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>examine
it.&nbsp; The vegetable matter derived from roots, and from the
plants themselves, give them a dark colour; but this burns away
in the firing, and the bricks come out of the kiln nearly a pure
white.&nbsp; It is almost invariably found that where the
vegetation of a seam of coal grew on the spot, and was not
transported, as was the case in some instances, that one of these
underclays is to be found still retaining very beautiful casts of
the roots of plants, and not unfrequently the seeds as well as
the plants themselves that grew above them.&nbsp; As fire-clays,
they are little if at all inferior to the famous Stourbridge
clays, and they supply an invaluable material for crucibles, for
bricks for the interior of our blast and puddling furnaces, for
the kilns of our potteries, and for various other purposes where
intense heat is required.</p>
<p>With regard to clays in general, and the art of working in
them, it may be remarked that arch&aelig;ologists have told us
little.&nbsp; They have divided the past history of the race into
the stone, bronze, and iron periods, but have told us nothing of
the age of clay, or of an art which we venture to say was one of
the oldest invented by man.&nbsp; Clay and clay-workers are found
everywhere; and the material is one of the most abundant provided
by Nature.&nbsp; The first man would find it soft, yielding, and
ready to his hands, with the impressions of birds and beasts,
suggestive of the use to which <a name="page11"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 11</span>it might be put, and the act of
moulding it into form would be as natural as that of plucking
fruit from a tree, or that of taking up a stone to strike a
harder blow than the hand could give.&nbsp; Hardening it in the
sun or baking it in a wood fire would be equally simple; whilst
the act of fashioning a shapeless mass into an enduring form
would yield so much pleasure that it would be repeated.&nbsp;
That the art is pre-historic, and began before the race commenced
a record of its doings, is evident from specimens which accompany
the remains of men of whose tribe and nation we know
nothing.&nbsp; Living beings stronger than man had been masters
of the globe before he came, and ignobly perished, leaving but
the impressions of their bones to tell of their existence; but
man brought with him a new element by which to subjugate and
subdue the materials he saw around him to his use, and left
behind him more enduring monuments.</p>
<p>Other enduring materials pressed into the service of
architects of ancient and modern times were once as incoherent a
mass of atoms, and as unshapable as these clays, and were either
earths, clays, or sands, which Nature by the processes of
kneading, pressing, and baking, in her great laboratory,
converted into stone.&nbsp; We find them to some extent ready
shaped to hand in the quarry, and we cut them into cubes or
blocks, and pile them up in buildings, according to the <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>humour or
taste of the time.&nbsp; Bricks are artificial stones, and in
making them we follow the example Nature set us only that we cut
the plastic material first of all to the size we desire it, then
convert it into stone by heat; and this artificial stone, we
venture to say, for durability and beauty, is equal even to
Nature&rsquo;s own production, and quite as suggestive to the
mind.&nbsp; Nature&rsquo;s finished material may be deemed more
suitable for churches; but artificial stone, fashioned into shape
by man, is quite as appropriate for a dwelling in which the
highest social sanctities gather.&nbsp; Indeed the art of using
artificial stone appears to have been roused from the torpor into
which it had fallen since Roman and Flemish authorities set such
good examples.&nbsp; People had been so long accustomed to see
brickwork used only for inferior houses, and stone for buildings
of greater pretensions that, till recently, English bricks have
scarcely had justice done them.</p>
<p>The antiquity of brickmaking is so well-known that it is
scarcely necessary to allude to it.&nbsp; It will suffice to
remind the reader of the tower of Babel, built about 400 years
after the period assigned to the flood.&nbsp; That bricks were
made in Egypt at an early period of her history is well known;
and that this same people had faith in their durability is clear
from the fact that they impressed them with hieroglyphics, or
historical records, transmitting to us the names of their <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>kings.&nbsp;
Mr. Smith of the British Museum, has brought home clay cylinders
which the Assyrians used for writing upon.&nbsp; Again, the way
in which Jewish writers speak of pots and potters, comparing
humanity to lumps of clay fashioned into vessels of honour and
dishonour, and the silly and wicked portion of humanity to
potsherds, good for nothing but to be cast upon the highway,
shows that they drew much of their philosophy from the art.&nbsp;
With them, as with other nations of antiquity, the art of working
in clay ranked high.&nbsp; Potters of the tribe of Judah
&ldquo;dwelt with the king.&rdquo;&nbsp; And one very noticeable
feature is the fact that the same simple means are still employed
to effect the same object; for illustrations in the catacombs of
Thebes show that forty centuries ago clay was kneaded with the
feet, turned upon a wheel, and baked in a circular oven, as at
present.&nbsp; The praise of those who out of rude clay fashioned
things of use and beauty, and impressed upon plastic materials
the living thoughts that stirred men&rsquo;s minds was loudly
sung, whilst the more successful cultivators of the art were
honoured with medals and statues, and their names transmitted by
poets and historians to posterity.&nbsp; The Greeks and Romans
gave a dignity to the art by raising it to a level with that of
sculpture.&nbsp; A Corinthian potter, Pliny tells us, was in his
day regarded as the first who contrived making likenesses in clay
by pressing the material up to the <a name="page14"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 14</span>outlines his daughter had drawn of
her lover&rsquo;s shadow on the wall and placing it with other
pottery to be hardened in the fire.&nbsp; Other authors ascribe
to the art a higher antiquity and speak of it as the parent of
sculpture.&nbsp; The estimation in which it was held is shown by
the fact that exhibitions of the best works in clay were
frequently held in Athens; and amongst the ruins of that city
statues of clay have been found, some in groups, representing
Grecian Mythology; and some of large size retaining portions of
the paint with which they were coloured on the eyes and
eyebrows.&nbsp; In the Townley Gallery of the British Museum, No.
38 is a statue of a Muse, three feet eleven inches high; and also
a terra-cotta statue of a Muse resting her left arm upon a pile
of writing tablets, which are placed upon a square column, but
the head is gone.&nbsp; The former represents Orania, the latter
Calliop, whose office it was to note down the worthy actions of
the living, as it was that of Clio&rsquo;s to celebrate those of
departed heroes.</p>
<p>Celts, Etruscans, and Chinese made early and great advances in
the art of using clay: the latter had even an imperial porcelain
work at King-te-Ching, a hundred and eighty-four years Before
Christ, and thirty years B.C. they introduced the same art into
Japan.</p>
<p>With regard to bricks and tiles we know that among Roman and
medi&aelig;val builders bricks made <a name="page15"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>of clay were held in high
estimation.&nbsp; The former enterprising people having
penetrated into our valleys and excavated our hill sides in
search of lead and iron were not likely to neglect the clays with
which the ore for the latter was associated; and evidences of the
extent to which they worked them on the banks of rivers, where
such seams were exposed, particularly on the banks of those
flowing through the great centres of their occupation, confirms
this view.&nbsp; Their armies were accompanied by men learned in
the art; and in the relics dug up at Malmesbury, Salisbury,
Romsey, Malvern, and Uriconium, modern workers in clay may learn
much of the early history of their craft.&nbsp; The still
upstanding walls at Wroxeter, with string courses of tiles, and
the numerous specimens of bricks, tesser&aelig;, and pottery in
different coloured clays, brought to light by excavations within
its shadow, are interesting from the fact that some are supposed
to have been manufactured from clays still in use in the
neighbourhood.</p>
<p>At Caersws, a little village on the banks of the Severn,
between Llandinam and Newtown, well made bricks, both of
composite and simple clay, may be seen stamped with Roman
letters, probably the initials of workmen&rsquo;s names; and, as
a test of the durability of both, it may be remarked that after
having done duty in buildings in which the Roman masons placed
them, they have been rebuilt by British workmen into the chimneys
of <a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>the
village.&nbsp; These, of course were burnt; but, favoured by the
extreme dryness and heat of their own climate, the Romans, like
the Egyptians, used clay mixed with chopped straw, to assist the
tenacity of their bricks, which, without being at all
artificially heated, have lasted thousands of years.&nbsp; The
material of which Roman bricks in this country were formed was
usually a strong clay, such as brickmakers call tile-clay; well
tempered, well pressed, and well burnt, producing a heavy tough
brick, indefinitely durable, and of a good deep-red colour.</p>
<p>Roofing tiles have been made in a similar way to bricks, one
would imagine, looking at the specimens found at Wroxeter and
other places from the time of Roman occupation down to the
present.&nbsp; They are found in double layers, forming slightly
projecting string-courses in the buildings, but larger and
thicker than ours; some of those dug up at Wroxeter being 17
inches by 12, and 4 inches thick, whilst some are 21 inches
square.&nbsp; One of these larger ones has the impression of the
foot of an ox, evidently received whilst in the process of
drying.&nbsp; Very many interesting specimens of bricks, tiles,
and pottery are found here, and the art of working up the clays
of the district has no doubt been practised from that time to the
present.</p>
<p>Formerly clays were allowed to lie during the winter to
weather as it is called; and a statute <a name="page17"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>now obsolete required, under a
penalty, that bricks should not be made unless the clay for
making them had been turned over at intervals, three times at
least before the 1st of March.&nbsp; But brickmakers now, not
having patience to wait for the action of the weather, have
invented machinery to do the work, and the clay is taken direct
from the pit to be crushed by iron rollers, and conveyed by
coarse canvas screens to the pug-mill.&nbsp; This is an upright
cylinder, with a revolving vertical shaft, fitted up with
horizontal knives following each other at an angle so as to cut,
amalgamate, temper the material, and fit it for use.&nbsp; The
process of forming the brick itself requires more tact than the
reader would imagine, as the yielding clay has to be thrown into
the mould so that every part shall be filled up with a body of
equal consistency.&nbsp; To cause the clay to leave the mould,
the latter is each time dipped into water, in which case the
process is called slop-moulding, or is sprinkled over with sand
or coke-dust; and when so made the brick is placed lengthways
with others on smooth flats, half an inch or an inch apart and
allowed to dry.&nbsp; The best kind of bricks are subjected to
considerable pressure in the mould by means of a machine, and a
hollow is left inside for the mortar, to enable them to fit close
in the joint.&nbsp; Ornamental bricks of elaborate design for
architectural purposes require more delicate manipulation, and
the clays for these undergo more careful preparation.&nbsp;
Machines also are used <a name="page18"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 18</span>which take the clay from the
crushing-rollers, temper and thoroughly amalgamate it, and
convert it into the finished article.</p>
<p>The old methods of preparing clay for bricks and tiles, still
practised by some firms, is probably the best where a good tough
article is required: that is treading and hand-tempering by the
workman, who kneads it with his naked feet, and
&ldquo;slaps&rdquo; or &ldquo;wedges&rdquo; it by breaking off
pieces and beating one against another.&nbsp; Machinery, however,
is extensive used, and horizontal rollers are set so as to secure
different degrees of fineness, in conduction with the
pug-mill.</p>
<p>Lime is a great enemy to good bricks, as small portions escape
both rollers and pug-mill, and being converted into quicklime by
burning, it slacks and bursts bricks subject to rains and
frosts.&nbsp; Compare the sound, and hard durable bricks made
here with those made near London, into which Cockneys knock their
nails without troubling themselves to look for a joint, and say
whether, with less freights, they might not be made to supersede
the rubbish passing under the name of London bricks, which are
soft, damp, and perishable, and some of which, like others of
inferior quality, will hold from a pint to a quart of
water.&nbsp; Stone, as shewn by the new Houses of Parliament,
will not withstand the action of the corroding acid to be found
in a London atmosphere; but good hard Shropshire bricks will, and
for public <a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>buildings, to say nothing of ordinary domestic
structures, they are invaluable.</p>
<p>The Staffordshire blue bricks which of late years have come
into such general use, particularly in buildings connected with
railways, are made from a clay containing a large proportion of
peroxide of iron, a clay which produces a red, a buff, or a blue
brick according to the process of firing and the degree of heat
it undergoes in the kiln; but it will in no case stand a
terra-cotta heat, in consequence of the iron acting as a
flux.&nbsp; But the great centres of the art of brick making are
on the banks of the Severn.&nbsp; Clay and clay workers are to be
found at Lilleshall, Lightmoor, Horsehay, and the Woodlands,
where, as at Broseley, clays are found on the surface.&nbsp;
Here, on the valley side the surface is honeycombed by burrowings
after clay and coal.&nbsp; One of the most important beds of clay
for making ordinary bricks and tiles is one 17 feet in thickness,
worked in many places by shallow shafts, and levels driven into
the hill sides, which when abandoned cause the surface to
collapse, and the ground to crack, as if by an earthquake.&nbsp;
A very pretty church, built a century since on the brow of the
hill overlooking some of the brickfields, is now a complete
wreck, in consequence of these burrowings after clay.&nbsp; The
chancel is falling away from the body of the building, the walls
are torn from the roof to the foundation, and the windows have
fallen from <a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>their places, leaving the oak pews and handsome marble
monuments a prey to the elements.&nbsp; Clays and coals are being
pared away from around it as a mouse would pare a cheese.&nbsp;
Of course the bishop cautions and threatens, but as long as his
lordship declines to go into the mines these sappers and miners
are safe; and to them must succumb not only the church, but the
graveyard&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Where the rude forefathers of the hamlet
sleep.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In conversation with the President of the Academy of Science
at St. Petersburgh, who some years ago visited this district, and
with other gentlemen distinguished in science and art, we have
heard the highest admiration expressed of these clays of the
Severn Valley.&nbsp; Indeed, the very handsome public
structures&mdash;now that prejudice is giving way, and that
improved and more artistic treatment of the material
predominates&mdash;which we see in towns erected upon true
architectural principles, and by professors of classical and
constructive styles of decoration, are sufficient indications of
the capability of the material in all its varieties for producing
works of a very high order of merit, with a light and aerial
effect not found in the old red brick, nor even in many of the
stone erections, of former times.</p>
<p>Besides bricks and tiles, these clays have been turned to
account from very early periods in other ways, as for pottery,
for instance, of different kinds.</p>
<p><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>We have
no reliable authority for fixing the date at which the art of
potting was first practised in Shropshire, but it appears clear
that the articles were of the simplest kind, being almost
uniformly domestic: those in daily use, such as milk-pans,
dishes, tea-pots, jugs, and mugs.&nbsp; The latter were
substitutes for the drinking horns, which later improvements in
the plastic and ceramic arts have driven out of use.&nbsp; We
have an ancient specimen of one made at the Pitchyard, and a
drawing of another made at Haybrook, well <i>potted</i>, and
elegant in shape.&nbsp; The latter is the best manipulated, and
probably it was from this circumstance that the latter work was
called &ldquo;The Mug-House.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In evidence adduced sometime since in an Election Scrutiny at
Bewdley, a public-house referred to was called the
&ldquo;Mughouse,&rdquo; which house is situated on the Severn, at
a point where the bargemen, who formerly drew the vessels up the
river instead of horses, were in the habit of stopping to get
mugs of ale.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tots&rdquo; were made out of the same
kind of clay, but smaller, and were used when the men drank in
company; hence a person who had drank too much was supposed to
have been with a convivial party, and was said to have been
&ldquo;totty,&rdquo; a word often found in old works.&nbsp; Tots
had no handles, and some of the old drinking cups, more
particularly those of glass of Anglo Saxon make, were rounded at
the bottom that they should not stand upright, and that a man may
empty them at a draught,&mdash;the custom continuing <a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>till later
times gave rise to our modern name of tumbler.&nbsp; The small
tots had no handles; the mug had a &ldquo;stouk,&rdquo; as it is
called, consisting of a single piece of clay, flattened and bent
over into a loop.&nbsp; The ware was similar to the famous
&ldquo;Rockingham ware&rdquo; made on the estate of Earl
Fitzwilliam, near Wentworth.</p>
<p>The discovery of a salt glaze took place in 1690, and the
manufacture of that kind of ware must have commenced here soon
after, as traces of works of the kind are abundant.&nbsp; This
method consisted in throwing salt into the kiln when the ware had
attained a great heat, holes being left in the clay boxes that
contained it in order that the fumes may enter and vitrify the
surface.&nbsp; Evidences of the manufacture of these old mugs and
tots, together with milk-pans and washing-pans, having been made
at an early period, are numerous; and the old seggars in which
they were burnt often form walls of the oldest cottages in
Benthall and Broseley Wood.</p>
<p>A considerable number of old jars, mugs, and other articles,
have from time to time been found in places and under
circumstances sufficient to indicate great antiquity; as in
mounds overgrown with trees, and in old pits which for time
immemorial have not been worked.&nbsp; One large earthen jar,
with &ldquo;George Weld,&rdquo; in light clay, was found in an
old drain at Willey, and is now in the possession of Lord
Forester.&nbsp; Mr. John <a name="page23"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 23</span>Thursfield, who lived at Benthall
hall, was at one time proprietor of these works.</p>
<p>Three quarters of a century ago these works were carried on by
Messrs. Bell &amp; Lloyd; afterwards by Mr. John Lloyd, one of
the best and most truly pious men we ever knew, who some time
before his death transferred them to a nephew, Mr. E.
Bathurst.&nbsp; His son succeeded him, and after a time sold them
to the present proprietor, Mr. Allen, who to the ordinary red and
yellow ware, which finds a ready sale in North and South Wales,
has added articles of use and ornament in other ways, including
forcing pots, garden vases, and various terra cotta articles.</p>
<p>Of the Pitchyard works we know little, only that they stood
where the late Mr. E. Southorn carried on his Pipe Works, and
where we remember them in ruins more than fifty years ago; but
the numerous seggars, now found in cottage garden walls, shew
that they must have been continued for some considerable
time.</p>
<p>But, besides the manufacture of bricks, tiles, and pottery,
these clays have been raised to a trade within the past few years
in this district which is every day increasing, and which is
capable of much further expansion: we refer now to the important
department of encaustic or inlaid tiles and mosaics.&nbsp; The
art of producing tiles of this description is only recently
revived in this country, and is one which in point of antiquity
is not to be compared with its sister branches.&nbsp; The first
attempt, <a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>so far as we are aware, to revive the art in Shropshire,
was at Jackfield; but the first designs were crude, quaint, and
spiritless, and altogether wanting in those nicer distinctions
and qualities which, not being perceived by the mind of the
producer, could not be wrought by the hand.&nbsp; In this as in
many other branches of fictile art <i>insight</i> into the
principles as well as eyesight is required, and the
mistake&mdash;as in many other instances&mdash;was committed of
attempting something which, with the expenditure of thought and
time, might catch the uneducated eye&mdash;the object being to
produce <i>quantity</i> rather than <i>quality</i>.&nbsp; But the
call made upon the art by the enlightened demands of the age soon
gave a wonderful impetus to the improvement, and men of educated
artistic taste&mdash;like the Mintons and the Maws&mdash;soon
called to their aid the assistance of the greatest genius and the
highest designing talent at command; at the same time that they
directed their efforts to definite points in which utility might
be made the instrument of beauty, and by which originality and
intelligible design might be made to rise out of the most
common-place wants.&nbsp; But although the modern manufacture of
geometric and encaustic tiles is recent, it already far surpasses
the ancients in variety and arrangement, in geometric patterns,
and in beauty of design in encaustics as well as in mechanical
finish; although it may be doubted whether the same breadth of
general effect is studied as in many <a name="page25"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 25</span>ancient examples.&nbsp; Mintons, of
Stoke, Maw and Co., of Benthall, Hargraves and Craven, of
Jackfield, and Mr. Bathurst, of Broseley, have each produced
beautiful encaustic tiles for pavements&mdash;both for
ecclesiastical and domestic use; and there is yet a large field
for development of the use of similar tiles to colour and enrich
the details of our street architecture, as well as in that of
more elaborate and important structures.</p>
<p>The Coalbrookdale Co., have recently manufactured some
admirable terra-cotta entablatures, with historical subjects for
costly buildings in the metropolis.&nbsp; The erection of the
Literary and Scientific Institution also, of different coloured
clays shews their adaptation to works of great architectural
beauty.</p>
<h2><span class="smcap">Maw and Co&rsquo;s Tesselated</span>,
<span class="smcap">Mosaic</span>, <span class="smcap">and
Majolica Works</span>.</h2>
<p>It was the excellency of the Broseley and Benthall clays,
above referred to, which attracted the Messrs. Maw to the spot
and led them to remove from Worcester, to where they had been in
the habit, first of all, of having them conveyed by barges on the
river, to the present site of their works, fashioned out of the
old Benthall Iron Works, carried on a century ago by Mr. Harries,
then owner of the Benthall estate.&nbsp; Notwithstanding the
additions made by them, the trade has so wonderfully developed
itself that after building <a name="page26"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 26</span>upon or in some way occupying every
inch of ground, they are cramped for room, and have purchased a
piece of ground at the Tuckies on which they are about to erect
more commodious premises.</p>
<p>In addition to those classical and other adjuncts of
architectural comfort and embellishment, embracing encaustic
tiles&mdash;the reproduction of an art limited in medi&aelig;val
times to church decoration, but now having a much more extended
application, and the manufacture of tesser&aelig;, used in the
construction of geometrical mosaic pavements, similar in
character to those found in the medi&aelig;val buildings of
Italy, also moresque mosaics, like those occurring in Roman
remains in this country and on the continent, they now
manufacture a superior majolica, and faience of great purity, in
both of which departments they have recently received <a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>first class
medals at the Philadelphia exhibition.&nbsp; The accompanying
engraving will convey an idea of the adaptation of faience to
articles of domestic utility.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Jackfield Pottery and
Porcelain</span>.</h2>
<p>Older even than the Haybrook Mug House are the Pot Works of
Jackfield, which, according to the parish register of
Stoke-upon-Trent, quoted by Mr. Jewitt and Mr. Chaffers, supplied
a race of potters to that great centre of early pot-making in the
year 1560.&nbsp; Excavations made too, some years ago, brought to
light on a spot near which the present works of Craven, Dunnill
&amp; Co., now stand, an oven, or kiln, with unbaked ware, which
appeared to have been buried by a land-slip; and in an old pit,
which it was said had not been opened for two centuries, a brown
mug was discovered, which had upon it the date 1634.&nbsp; If
Jackfield supplied early potters for Stoke, Stoke sent pot
masters to Jackfield.&nbsp; One of these was Mr. Richard
Thursfield, an ancestor of Greville T. Thursfield M.D., who took
these works and carried them on in 1713.&nbsp; He was succeeded
by his son John, of whom we have spoken as afterwards living at
Benthall and carrying on works there.&nbsp; The late Richard
Thursfield, Esq., had in his possession some good examples of
Jackfield ware.&nbsp; Among them was a handsome jug, gilt, having
on it, we believe, the name of one of the family.</p>
<p><a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>In
1772, or soon after, Mr. Simpson carried on the works; and he
appears to have further improved the manufacture, for in addition
to the &ldquo;black decanters,&rdquo; as his mugs were called, he
made various articles of superior quality, which prior to the
breaking out of the war with America found a ready sale
there.&nbsp; The old mill turned by the waters of the Severn,
where he ground his materials, has just been taken down.</p>
<p>Mr. Blakeway afterwards carried on the works, and was joined
by Mr. John Rose, upon leaving Caughley, and, after carrying them
on a short time by himself, he removed them, as he did the
Caughley Works, to Coalport, on the opposite bank of the
river.</p>
<p>The site of the old pottery was on the ground which is now
occupied by the Jackfield Encaustic Tile Works, the clays of
which are specially adapted for geometrical and encaustic tiles;
and such tiles have been made here for a number of years; but
since the old works, came into the possession of the present firm
of Messrs. Craven, Dunnill and Co., great changes have taken
place.&nbsp; The firm took a lease of about four acres of ground,
and adjoining the old works built a large and commodious
manufactory, which has been in operation for nearly two
years.&nbsp; They have since taken down all the buildings of the
old works, and have erected on their site and joining up to the
new works, large warehouses, show room, offices, and entrance
lodge.&nbsp; The plan of the works is very <a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>complete, so
as in every way to economise in the process of manufacture, and
they are now among the most complete works of the kind.</p>
<p>As shewn in the accompanying engraving, the buildings consist
of four blocks, one detached and the others connected, each block
accommodating a separate branch of the manufacture.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p28b.jpg">
<img alt=

</a></p>
<p>In the detached block the raw materials are reduced to a state
ready for the workman.</p>
<p>The second block contains the damping places, where the clays
are kept in a certain degree of moisture; pressers&rsquo; shops
for the various colours of geometrical tiles, and the encaustic
tile makers&rsquo; shops, with their stoves.</p>
<p>The next block provides for the drying and firing of the goods
and decorating shops.</p>
<p>On the first floor are workshops employed for painting,
printing and enamelling, or other decorative purposes.</p>
<p>The fourth block provides for the sorting and stocking of
goods and for packing them for despatch; also the offices and
showroom.</p>
<p>Near to the detached block first described a small gas-works
has been erected, which supplies the whole of the buildings.</p>
<h2><span class="smcap">Caughley</span>.</h2>
<p>Like the works previously mentioned, those of Caughley were
upon the outcrop of the coals and clays of the Shropshire
coal-field.&nbsp; They were established about the middle of the
17th century, <a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
31</span>on the estate of Mr. Brown, who lived at Caughley Hall,
and was an ancestor of T. Wylde Brown, Esq., of the Woodlands,
near Bridgnorth.&nbsp; An opaque stone china appears to have been
made there in the first instance.</p>
<p>The works appear to have been carried on by Mr. Brown, in the
first place, and then by Mr. Gallimore, a relative of Mr.
Brown&rsquo;s; and afterwards by M. Turner, who succeeded in
producing an article of very superior merit, and one which will
always hold a distinguished place in the history of the ceramic
art.&nbsp; Mr. Turner was the son of the Rev. Richard Turner,
D.D., rector of Cumberton, vicar of Emley Castle and Norton, and
Chaplain to the Countess of Wigtown.&nbsp; Thomas his son, was
born 1749, and married in 1783, Miss Dorothy Gallimore, a niece
of Mr. Brown, of Caughley Hall.&nbsp; Mr. Turner was a gentleman
of great taste, a good draughtsman, and an excellent engraver,
having learned the latter art at Worcester, probably under Robert
Hancock, some very fine examples of whose work are in the
possession of Mr. Arthur Maw, of Severn House, who also has many
very fine productions of Caughley at the best period of its
existence.&nbsp; In 1780 Mr. Turner visited France, and brought
back with him several skilled workmen, and an architect, whom he
employed in the erection of a very handsome <i>chateau</i>, in
the French style of architecture.&nbsp; The works were several
years in progress, and were completed in 1775, as shewn by a
newspaper paragraph of November 1st <a name="page32"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 32</span>in that year, which, is as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The porcelain manufactory erected near
Bridgnorth, in this county, is now quite completed, and the
proprietors have received and supplied orders to a very large
amount.&nbsp; Lately we saw some of their productions which in
colour and fineness are truly elegant and beautiful, and have the
bright and lively white of the so much extolled
Oriental.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Printing on porcelain appears first to have been introduced by
Dr. Wall at the Worcester works, a process soon after taken to
Caughley by a person named Holdship, a former partner in the
Worcester works, where it was practised as a great secret, with
closed doors.</p>
<p>Mr. Chaffers says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The excellence of Turner&rsquo;s porcelain
and the invention of the beautiful dark blue of the Caughley
china, attributed to him, gained him great patronage.&nbsp; In
1780 he produced the celebrated &ldquo;willow pattern,&rdquo;
which even at the present day is in great demand, and the
&ldquo;blue dragon,&rdquo; another favourite pattern, and
completed the first <i>blue printed table service</i> made in
England for Thomas Whitmore, Esq., of Apley Park, near
Bridgnorth; the pattern was called <i>Nankin</i>, and was
something similar to the Broseley tea service produced in 1782,
all in porcelain.&nbsp; Mr. Thomas Minton, of Stoke, assisted in
the completion of this service, being articled as an engraver
there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Messrs. Chamberlain of Worcester, until the end of
1790, had their porcelain in the white from Thomas Turner of
Caughley.&nbsp; He at first mixed <a name="page33"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 33</span>all the bodies himself, but
afterwards instructed his sister how to do it; subsequently a man
named Jones mixed for him.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The other works at Worcester, Grainger &amp; Co., formerly,
when first established, merely painted and finished ware
manufactured at Caughley.&nbsp; The China so sent was marked with
the letter &ldquo;C.&rdquo; for Caughley; sometimes
&ldquo;S.&rdquo; for Salopian.</p>
<p>Among the chief workmen were the following:&mdash;Dontil,
painter; Muss and Silk, who afterwards attained great celebrity
in London, as painters on enamel, were landscape painters.&nbsp;
Thomas Fennell, and Edward Jones flower painters, Thomas Martin
Randall, bird painter, Edward Randall, gold decorator, Adams,
blue painter, De Vivy and Stephan, modellers.</p>
<p>Perry, one of the workmen who was apprenticed to Mr. Turner,
states that in 1797 they had four printing presses at Caughley,
introduced by Davis; the patterns at that time and for years
previously being birds and blue panels; that Turner had been an
engraver at Worcester; that he recollects a slab on the front of
one of the arches of the building at Caughley, stating the date
of its foundation, 1772, which would be the time he succeeded Mr.
Gallimore, and that it was not finished for some time after.</p>
<p>In the Salopian Mag. we gave an engraving of the old works,
from a view in the possession of Mr. Hubert Smith, the only
lineal descendent of Mr. Turner; and also of a &ldquo;puzzle
jug,&rdquo; now in <a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
34</span>the possession of Mr. E. Thursfield, of
Bridgnorth.&nbsp; It is eight inches in height, and is formed of
the usual body of these works.&nbsp; It is decorated with blue
sprigs, and bears on its front the name, in an oval border,
of</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">John Geary<br />
Cleak of the<br />
Old Church<br />
Brosley<br />

</blockquote>
<p>On the bottom is written in blue &ldquo;Mathew th v &amp;
16,&rdquo; though one would fail to see any allusion in the text
here referred to either to the vessel or to its purpose.</p>
<p>The first specimens of Caughley are but little removed from
earthenware, but the material speedily improved, as did the
manipulation or potting; the latter to an extent as regards shape
and outline so much so as to render many of them superior to the
same class of articles of the present day.&nbsp; Their excellence
in this respect is so self-evident as still to render Caughley
china a great favourite.&nbsp; Choice articles of this
manufacture are carefully guarded by Shropshire families, with
whom they have become heirlooms; they are carefully stored in
corner cupboards and on kitchen shelves, where they were once
kept in countenance by rows of shining pewter, and are only
produced at christenings and weddings, and on such red-letter
days and rare occasions.&nbsp; Every year will add to their
value, to the veneration in <a name="page35"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 35</span>which they are held; and at distant
periods, and when compared even with the ordinary productions of
our factories at the present day, they will serve to show how
successful were the well-directed efforts at the Caughley Works
to produce a porcelain which should take high rank and maintain
it.</p>
<p>The buildings of the old factory have been razed to the
ground; the plough passes over where they stood, and a few
pitchers turned up now and then are the only indications obtained
of these interesting works.&nbsp; But a class of clever men were
educated there; some of whom&mdash;as the late Herbert
Minton&rsquo;s father, John Rose, and others&mdash;have done much
to raise the character of our English productions.</p>
<h2><span class="smcap">Coalport Porcelain Works</span>.</h2>
<p>The first works at Coalport were we believe founded and
carried on by William Reynolds, Thomas Rose, Robert Horton, and
Robert Anstice; the former William Reynolds, being then Lord of
the Manor.&nbsp; The buildings, or a good portion occupied by
them are still standing.</p>
<p>Mr. Thomas Rose, and Mr. John Rose, were sons of a respectable
farmer living at Sweeney.&nbsp; The latter was a clerk under Mr.
Turner, at Caughley, and left him to take the Jackfield works
about the year, it is said, 1780.&nbsp; Having carried them on
for a few years, in conjunction with Mr. Blakeway, during which
time he greatly improved <a name="page36"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 36</span>the quality of the article
manufactured there, he established the present Coalport works on
the side of the canal, then recently opened, and opposite to
those of Reynolds, Horton, Thomas Rose, and Robert Anstice.&nbsp;
On Mr. Turner retiring from the Caughley works in 1799, Mr. Rose
and the new company he had formed purchased them, and by means of
increased capital shortly afterwards removed both plant and
materials from Caughley and Jackfield to the more advantageous
position they now occupy, on the banks of the canal and the
Severn.&nbsp; Even the buildings were pulled down and the bricks
and timber removed to the opposite side of the Severn, where they
were used in constructing the cottages now standing opposite to
the present Coalport Works.</p>
<p>A staff of excellent work-people had been obtained from
Caughley and Jackfield works combined, but an accident occurred
on the night of the 23rd of October in that year by the capsizing
of the ferry, as the work-people were crossing the Severn, by
which twenty-eight were drowned, some among them being the best
hands employed at the works.&nbsp; It was a dark night, the boat
was crowded, and the man at the helm, not having been accustomed
to put the boat over allowed the vessel to swing round in the
channel where, with a strong tide running, it was drawn under by
the rope which went from the mast to a rock in the bed of the
river.&nbsp; Some managed to scramble out on the Broseley side of
the stream; but the following <a name="page37"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 37</span>were lost, notwithstanding the
efforts of those who rushed to the river side on hearing the
despairing cries raised to save them.&nbsp; Jane Burns, Sarah
Burns, Ann Burns, Mary Burgess, Elizabeth Fletcher, Mary
Fletcher, Elizabeth Beard, Jane Boden, Elizabeth Ward, Sarah
Bagnall, Sophia Banks, Mary Miles, Elizabeth Evans, Catherine
Lowe, Jane Leigh, Charles Walker, George Lynn, James Farnworth,
George Sheat, John Chell, Robert Lowe, William Beard, John Jones,
Benjamin Gosnall, Benjamin Wyld, Richard Mountford, Joseph Poole,
and another.&nbsp; The twenty-eight lost included some of the
best artists; and an unfinished piece of work, left by Charles
Walker but a few minutes before he lost his life, was till within
a few years ago reverently kept in the warehouse as a memento of
the unfortunate event.</p>
<p>The event, as may be expected, created a great sensation at
the time, and was thus commemorated, by Mr. Dyas, one of the
Coalport workmen:</p>
<p class="poetry">Alas! Alas! the fated night<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of cold October twenty third,<br />
In seventeen hundred ninety-nine;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; What cries, what lamentation heard,<br />
The hour nine, when from yon pile,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where fair porcelain takes her form,<br />
Where energy with genius joins,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To robe her in those matchless charms,<br />
A wearied band of artists rose,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Males and females, old and young,<br />
Their toil suspend, to seek repose,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their homes to gain, they bent along.<br />
<a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
38</span>Sabrina&rsquo;s stream was near to pass,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And she her frowning waves upraised,<br />
Her mist condensed to darksome haze<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which mocked the light; no star appeared.<br />
Yon boat, which o&rsquo;er her bosom rides,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Enveloped in the heavy gloom,<br />
Convulsive stretch&rsquo;d along her sides,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To snatch the victims to their doom.<br />
Soon e&rsquo;er on board their faltering feet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A monster fell who grasped the helm,<br />

But Oh, the bleakest night preventing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Every means to save their breath,<br />
Helpless, hopeless, life despairing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Twenty-eight sunk down in death.<br />
Alas small time for Heaven&rsquo;s implorings,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; With mercy, justice, these abide.<br />
Return with sympathetic breath,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; See yon distracted mother stands,<br />
Three daughters lost, to heaven she lifts<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her streaming eyes and wringing hands,<br />
Hark! from those dells how deep the wailings,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Fathers, Mothers, join their moans,<br />
Widows, orphans, friends and lovers,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Swell the air with poignant groans;<br />
Recluse in grief, those worthy masters<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Silent drop the mournful tear.<br />
Distress pervades surrounding hamlets,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sorrow weeps to every ear,<br />
Sleepless sighings hail the morning,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Morning brings no soothing ray.</p>

author of these verses, Mr. Dyas, was a very clever carver on
stone and on wood.&nbsp; He engraved the blocks for a work
printed by Mr. Edmonds at Madeley, entitled
&ldquo;Alexander&rsquo;s Expedition down the Hydaspes and the
Indus to the Indian Ocean.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was the author too of
an invention world-wide in its benefits, that of the
printers&rsquo; roller; an invention second only to the art of
printing itself, and infinitely superior to thousands of others
out of which vast fortunes have been made.</p>
<p>In 1804 the company consisted of Cuthbert Johnson, William
Clarke, John Wootton, and John Rose.&nbsp; In 1811 it was John
Rose, William Clarke and Charles Maddison.&nbsp; In 1820 they
bought the famous Swansea works and entered into an agreement
with Messrs. Billingsley and Walker to make a superior kind of
porcelain made by them, first at Nantgarw in Glamorganshire, and
afterwards at the Cambrian Pottery, Swansea, in the same
county.&nbsp; This was a pure soft paste porcelain, superior to
any at present produced in the kingdom, and second only to the
famous <i>pate tendre</i> of Sevres at the very best period of
its manufacture.&nbsp; This china was first made in 1813 by
Billingsley, who went from Derby to Worcester, and from there to
South Wales.&nbsp; He was an artist, and understood the
manufacture in all its branches.&nbsp; He produced a fret body,
by mixing the materials, firing them in order to blend them
together, then <a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
40</span>reducing the vitrified substance into clay&mdash;a
process which was carried on at Old Sevres during the reign of
Louis XV.&mdash;and thereby produced an article fine in texture,
beautifully transparent, and of a delicate waxy hue, very
superior to the dingy blue tinge given to much of the best china
of that day.&nbsp; Connoisseurs were at once attracted by it, and
Mr. Mortlock went down and entered into an engagement to purchase
all that Billingsley and his son-in-law could make.&nbsp; Mr.
John Rose finding he had lost a customer, whilst orders he was
wont to receive were going to South Wales, went over, bought the
plant, moulds, and everything, and entered into an agreement with
Walker and Billingsley for a period of seven years to make the
same quality of china at Coalport.&nbsp; The process however was
an expensive one, from the difficulty of working the clay, which
wanted plasticity, and also from the loss in the burning, as
being a soft body it was apt to melt or warp, and to go out of
shape, if it had a little too much fire in the biscuit
kiln.&nbsp; About that time, too, Mr. Ryan discovered a very pure
felspar in the Middleton, one of the Briedden hills, the true
<i>Kaolin</i>, to which the Chinese were indebted for the quality
of their egg-shell and other first class china.&nbsp; The fret
body was therefore abandoned, the <i>pate tendre</i> for a
<i>pate dure</i>, as the French say, and by adding pure felspar
to the Cornish stone and clay which contains a large percentage,
a good transparent body was obtained <a name="page41"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 41</span>at a less cost than by using a
<i>fret body</i>.&nbsp; About this time also the Society of Arts
offered a prize to any one who should find a substitute for lead
in the glaze, the deleterious effects of which told upon the
dippers, and produced paralysis; and Mr. Rose by applying felspar
to the glaze succeeded in obtaining it.&nbsp; He was awarded the
Gold Medal of the Society; and from that time following, for some
years, a badge was either attached to the ware or engraved upon
it as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;Coalport Felspar Porcelain, J. Rose
&amp; Co: the Gold Medal awarded May 30, 1820; Patronised by the
Society of Arts.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Devonports and other
manufacturers competed for the prize.</p>
<p>The felspar porcelain however never equalled the original
Nantgarw fret body ware for purity and transparency, a white
plate of which would at the present time fetch a couple of
guineas.&nbsp; It cannot be said that any new element was
introduced by using felspar, because the kaolin, contained in
Cornish stone and clay, as discovered by Cookworthy in 1768, had
been, and was now used at Plymouth, Derby, Worcester, Caughley,
and Coalport; and by a judicious admixture of this and a free use
of bone (phosphate of lime) a good serviceable china was
produced.&nbsp; The former gave mellowness, and the latter
whiteness, which approached in a degree the qualities of old and
Oriental china.&nbsp; In fact Mr. Rose, who had the sole
management of the works, spared neither <a
name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>pains nor
expense in raising the character of the productions of the
Coalport Works, which were now by far the largest porcelain works
in the kingdom, if not in the world.&nbsp; Like Minton, he was a
man of wonderful energy, being strong in body, having a clear
head, a cool judgment, and gifted with remarkable
perseverance.</p>
<p>The works were now in a state of prosperity; warehouses were
opened in Manchester, London, Sheffield, and Shrewsbury, and a
large trade was being done with dealers all over the
kingdom.&nbsp; There was plenty of employment, and a good
understanding generally prevailed between masters and their work
people.&nbsp; Both before and after the strike there were at
Coalport, as at other works of the kind elsewhere, an intelligent
class of men, among potters and painters, as well as in other
departments.&nbsp; Painters, especially, had good opportunities
for mental culture and obtaining information.&nbsp; Numbers
worked together in a room, one sometimes reading for the benefit
of the others, daily papers were taken, discussions were often
raised, and in politics the sharp features of party were as
defined as in the House of Commons itself.&nbsp; The rooms were
nicely warmed, and a woman appointed to sweep up, to bring coals,
to keep the tables clean, to wash up dishes, peel potatoes, and
fetch water for those who, not living near, brought their meals
with them.&nbsp; It is not surprising, therefore, that men,
having such advantages, should sometimes rise to higher
situations.&nbsp; Some became <a name="page43"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 43</span>linguists, some schoolmasters,
engineers, and contractors; one, breakfasting with a bishop,
whose daughter he afterwards married, saw upon the table, some
time since, a service painted by himself when a workman at
Coalport.&nbsp; Some were singular characters: old Jocky Hill
kept his hunter; John Crowther, a very amiable fellow,
exceedingly good natured, and always ready to do a favour to any
one who asked him, lived quite a recluse, studying algebra and
mechanics.&nbsp; He has suggested many improvements in
locomotives, steam paddles, breaks, &amp;c., &amp;c., and had the
honour of submitting to the Government the plan of terminating
annuities, by which money at that time was raised to carry on the
war, and by which we have been saved the burden&mdash;so
far&mdash;of a permanent debt; also of making other suggestions,
which have been likewise adopted.&nbsp; He also invented a most
ingenious almanack applicable to all time.</p>
<p>Coalport men were usually great politicians; Hunt,
Hethrington, Richard Carlile, Sir Francis Burdett, and Cobbett,
had their disciples and admirers; and such was the eagerness to
get the Register, with its familiar gridiron on the cover, that a
man has been despatched to Birmingham for it from one of the
rooms, his shopmates undertaking to do his work for him whilst he
was away.</p>
<p>The works themselves are ill designed and badly constructed,
the greater portion of them having <a name="page44"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 44</span>been put up at the latter end of the
past and beginning of the present centuries, whilst other
portions were added from time to time, with no regard to
ventilation or other requirements of health.&nbsp; Consequently
there are the most curious ins and outs, dropsical looking roofs,
bulging walls, and drooping floors, which have to be propped
underneath, to support half a century&rsquo;s accumulations of
china, accumulations amounting to hundreds and hundreds of tons
in weight.&nbsp; In entering some of these unhealthy
<i>ateliers</i> and passages strangers have to look well to their
craniums.&nbsp; Some work-rooms have very stifling atmospheres,
charged with clay or flint; the biscuit room notably so.&nbsp; We
have said that a good understanding prevailed generally between
masters and workmen.&nbsp; There was one notable exception, the
great &ldquo;strike&rdquo; as it was called, which occurred
somewhere in November, 1833; a memorable event in the history of
the works, so much so that in speaking of occurrences it is usual
to the present time to ask in case of doubt if it happened before
or subsequent to the strike.&nbsp; The men had their
&ldquo;Pitcher,&rdquo; a well conducted sick society; and a
&ldquo;Travelling Society,&rdquo; for assisting those in search
of employment, with branches in all centres of the trade.&nbsp;
Trades unions, however, were just then coming to the front.&nbsp;
The Combination Laws had been repealed eleven years previously;
otherwise, such was the temper of the Shropshire magistrates, <a
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>and the
feeling generally in relation to the trades unions, that had they
existed on the statute book not a few would have had to have
experienced the penal consequences of their acts.&nbsp; With the
men who still adhered to the masters the works continued to be
carried on to a limited extent; after much suffering and
privation some of the hands returned, whilst some obtained
employment elsewhere.&nbsp; The course taken by Mr. John Rose, in
resisting the men was warmly approved of by his neighbours, who
subscribed for a handsome silver cup, which is now in the
possession of Mr. Charles Pugh, who married Miss Martha Rose,
daughter of Mr. Thomas, and niece of Mr. John Rose.&nbsp; It is a
large and massive piece of plate.&nbsp; A vine stem entwines
around the foot and forms the handles, a vine border with grapes
also forms a border round the rim of the cover.&nbsp; On one side
is the following inscription:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">Presented to John Rose
Esqr.,<br />
of<br />
Coalport China Manufactory,<br />
By his<br />
Friends and Neighbours<br />
March 3rd<br />
1834.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the reverse side is the following:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">Tribute of respect<br
/>
to his<br />
Public and Private Character<br />
<a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>and to
the<br />
uncompromising firmness<br />
with which<br />
he has recently resisted the<br />
demands of an illegal<br />
conspiracy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have lived to see trades unions legalized, and trade
combinations adopted by masters as well as men.</p>
<p>Mr. Walker had invented a maroon colour dip for grounds, which
was used with much success.&nbsp; A good deal was done too about
this time in imitation of the <i>Sevres</i> style of decoration,
and thousands of pounds were spent in endeavouring to make the
famous torquoise of the French; but a pale imitation, called
celest, only was obtained; some years afterwards however a much
better colour was produced, first by Mr. Harvey, secondly by Mr.
Bagshaw, thirdly by Mr. Hancock.</p>
<p>In 1839 the late William Pugh became one of the firm, it then
being John Rose, Charles Maddison, and William Pugh.&nbsp; In
1841 it was Charles Maddison, William Pugh, Thomas Rose, and
William Frederick Rose.&nbsp; In 1843 William Pugh, and William
F. Rose were the proprietors.&nbsp; In 1845 the Messrs. Daniell
received the command of the Queen to prepare a dessert service as
a present by herself to the Emperor Nicholas, and it was
manufactured at the works.&nbsp; It was a magnificent service of
<i>bleu de roi</i>, and had the <a name="page47"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 47</span>various orders of the Russian Empire
enamelled in compartments, with the order of St. Nicholas, and
the Russian and Polish eagles in the centre.&nbsp; In 1850 the
famous Rose-du-Barry was discovered.&nbsp; The attempt to do so
had been suggested by the Messrs. Daniell, in 1849; and after
repeated experiments by Mr. George Hancock, who is still the
colour-maker at the works, it was produced.&nbsp; This colour, so
named after Mdme du Barry, one of the mistresses of Louis XV, had
been formerly made at the Sevres Works, but the art had been
lost, and its reproduction created a demand for very rich dessert
services and ornaments of the colour.&nbsp; Very costly services
of it were produced for the Messrs. Daniell, Mortlock, Phillips,
Goode, and other London dealers, which attracted considerable
attention at the Exhibition of 1851.&nbsp; One splendid dessert
service of it was purchased by Lord Ashburton; others also, after
special models and designs, of this colour were subsequently
produced for the head of the State, for the Emperor of the
French, and for noblemen like the duke of Northumberland, the
Marquis of Lansdowne and others.</p>
<p>The following are the remarks of the Jurors on that
occasion:&mdash;&ldquo;Rose J., and Co., Coalbrook Dale,
Shropshire (47, p. 727), have exhibited porcelain services and
other articles, which have attracted the special attention of the
Jury.&nbsp; A dessert service of a rose ground is in particular
remarkable, not <a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
48</span>only as being the nearest approach we have seen to the
famous colour which it is designed to imitate, but for the
excellence of the flower-painting, gilding, and other
decorations, and the hardness and transparency of glaze.&nbsp;
The same observation applies to other porcelain articles
exhibited by this firm.&nbsp; The Jury have awarded to Messrs.
Rose and Co. a Prize Medal.&rdquo;&nbsp; The company also
obtained medals at the French Exhibition in 1855, and at that of
London in 1862.</p>
<p>A good deal has been done of late years in the Sevres style of
decoration on vases, the moulds of which came direct from Sevres
manufactory.&nbsp; It is a pleasing incident, and one worth
mentioning, that some years ago Mr. W. F. Rose in company with
Mr. Daniell visited Paris, and of course went to Sevres.&nbsp;
Mr. Daniell was at once taken round the works, but Mr. Rose
feeling some delicacy remained outside.&nbsp; Mr. Daniell
mentioned the delicacy of his friend, and the manager at once
sent for him in, and shewed him the greatest respect.&nbsp; He
told him he might send his best artists to copy any thing he saw,
or employ theirs to do so: and sometime after he sent over the
moulds themselves to Coalport.</p>
<p>In 1862 Mr. Pugh became sole proprietor of the works, and
continued so to his death, in June 1875.&nbsp; Mr. Charles Pugh,
brother of the deceased, and Mr. Edmund Ratcliff, brother-in-law,
were left executors; and for an adjustment of claims by <a
name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>them and
others the estate was thrown into Chancery and a receiver and
manager, Mr. Gelson was appointed.&nbsp; The stock which is
immense and had been accumulating for half a century is being
brought into the market.&nbsp; Hundreds of dozens of one pattern,
&ldquo;India tree,&rdquo; for example, which had remained out of
sight for forty years, are being brought to light.&nbsp; In some
instances a hundred dozen or so of saucers, (printed,) are found
stowed away, without cups to match; whilst scores of piles of
plates and dishes, sixteen or eighteen feet high, may be seen
(white) in others, which had been sorted and put on one side from
some defect or other.&nbsp; It speaks well for the quality of the
china that the biscuit and glazed are both sound and good.&nbsp;
In some cases the floors are literally giving way from the
immense weight of stock they have to sustain.&nbsp; In one place
a quantity of old Caughley China was discovered; whilst in
another were found a number of Caughley copper plates engraved by
the late Herbert Minton&rsquo;s father.</p>
<p>It may excite surprise that so large a stock should have been
allowed to accumulate, but much was the result of a wish to keep
the men employed.&nbsp; The fact of a number of copper plates
being found with his name on, confirms what we have previously
said about Thomas Minton, who founded the important commercial
house bearing his name and that of his son at Stoke, having been
employed <a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>as an engraver at Caughley.&nbsp; M. Digby Wyatt, also,
in his paper read before the Society of Arts and reported in the
Society&rsquo;s Journal, May 28th, 1858, on the influence
exercised on ceramic art by the late Herbert Minton,
says:&mdash;&ldquo;Mr. Thomas Minton was a native of Shropshire,
and he was brought up at the Caughley works, near Broseley, as an
engraver.&nbsp; He then went to town and worked for Spode, at his
London House of business.&rdquo;&nbsp; In 1788 he went to Stoke,
bought land, and built the house and works which have since
become so celebrated.&nbsp; Up to 1798 however he only made
earthenware which was printed and ornamented in blue, similar to
that at Caughley.</p>
<p>Mr. Wyatt, in the paper just quoted, speaking of John Rose and
of the late Herbert Minton admitted that in the excellent, rapid,
and cheap production of porcelain for Mr. Minton to have stood
still for a moment would have been to have lost his lead in the
trade.&nbsp; And Mr. Daniell, in the discussion which followed,
said:&mdash;&ldquo;With reference to Mr. Minton&rsquo;s
predecessors in this branch of art, he might remind the society
of one whose name was upon their records as the recipient of the
society&rsquo;s gold medal for china and porcelain manufactures
long before Mr. Herbert Minton&rsquo;s time.&nbsp; He referred to
John Rose, of Coalport, who made more china in his day than all
those who were mentioned in the paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It will be seen from what we have written that <a
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>Thomas
Turner, of Caughley, and J. Rose, of Coalport, were the creators,
so to speak, of new industries which drew around them large
populations and gave employment to thousands who otherwise might
have sought for it in vain, or have found it under less
advantageous circumstances.&nbsp; It will be seen also that not
only were they benefactors contributing materially to the common
stock of national prosperity themselves, but that their energies
and abilities inspired others who in turn became industrial
organisers, and through various channels carried on the work of
progress.</p>
<h2>MADELEY CHINA WORKS.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Excepting</span> to the trade, and to some
of the old inhabitants, it is not generally known that Martin
Randall established China Works at Madeley, and made porcelain
similar to that of Nantgarw and little if at all inferior to old
Sevres porcelain.&nbsp; He and his brother Edward were Caughley
men; he left there to go to Derby.&nbsp; He afterwards went to
Pinxton, and thence with Mr. Robins, a Pinxton man, to London,
where they entered into partnership and carried on
business.&nbsp; They were supplied with Nantgarw white china by
Mr. Mortlock, till Mr. Rose cut off the supply from the Welsh
Works, by engaging <a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
52</span>Billingsley and Walker to make it for himself alone at
the Coalport Works.&nbsp; They still continued to carry on
business at Islington, where they erected buildings suitable, and
fired the ware in box kilns with charcoal.</p>
<p>About this time the demand was great with connoisseurs among
the aristocracy for old Sevres china; and the London dealers,
finding that it was not obtainable in sufficient quantities to
meet the demand for highly decorated specimens, hit upon the
expedient of employing agents in Paris to buy up Sevres china in
white for the purpose of having it painted in London, as Nantgarw
had been, and selling it to their customers as the bona fide
productions of Sevres.&nbsp; Slightly painted patterns too were
procured, and the colours got off with fluoric acid, and rich and
expensive paintings, grounds, and gilding substituted.</p>
<p>About the year 1826 they dissolved partnership and Mr. Randall
came to Madeley, where he occupied a house in Park Lane, now the
residence of the Wesleyan minister.&nbsp; He then took more
commodious premises at the lower end of Madeley, where he erected
enamelling, biscuit, and other kilns, and made and finished his
own ware.&nbsp; Thomas Wheeler, William Roberts, and F. Brewer,
were his potters; Philip Ballard, Robert Grey, and the present
writer, were painters there, and Enos Raby was ground
layer.&nbsp; John Fox of Coalbrookdale, William Dorsett, of
Madeley, also were with <a name="page53"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 53</span>Mr. Randall for a short time.&nbsp;
Not having had experience in the making of china, great mistaken
were committed, and heavy losses sustained.&nbsp; We have known a
biscuit kiln fired till tea-pots and cups and saucers were melted
into a mass before a trial was drawn, crow bars being necessary
to remove them; in some instances they assumed the most fantastic
forms.&nbsp; At other times the ware would be short fired in the
biscuit kiln and would take up so much glaze that on coming out
of the glaze kiln it would fly off in splinters.&nbsp; These
wastrels were buried, broken up, or thrown into the canal, to be
out of sight.</p>
<p>Mr. Randall however, as the result of repeated and persevering
experiments, succeeded in producing a fret body with a rich glaze
which bore so close a resemblance to old Sevres china that
connoisseurs and famous judges failed to distinguish them.&nbsp;
He refused however, from conscientious motives, to put the Sevres
mark, the initials of Louis.&nbsp; Louis, crossed at the bottom,
which was done with less hesitation at Coalport with much more
feeble imitations.&nbsp; When introduced on one occasion to a
London dealer, of the name of Frost, who had a shop in the
Strand, as Mr. Martin Randall&rsquo;s nephew, the dealer in old
china observed that the old Quaker made the best imitation of
Sevres that ever was made, but added, &ldquo;he never could be
got to put the double L on it, and we cannot sell it as
Sevres.&rdquo;&nbsp; We remarked that he was &ldquo;too <a
name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>conscientious
to do so,&rdquo; upon which he replied, &ldquo;O, d&mdash;n
conscience; there is no conscience in business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Randall had less hesitation however in putting the Sevres
mark on what was known to be Sevres; and he did very much for
Mortlock, Jarman, and Baldock, who had agents in Paris, attending
all sales where old Sevres was to be sold, in redecorating it in
the most elaborate and costly manner.&nbsp; The less scrupulous
London agents however did not hesitate to pass it off as being
really the work throughout of Sevres artists.&nbsp; Indeed they
have been known to have boxes of china going up from Madeley,
sent on to Dover, to be redirected as coming from France,
inviting connoisseurs to come and witness them being unpacked on
their arrival, as they represented, from Paris.&nbsp; A little
entertainment would be got up, and supposing themselves to be the
first whose eyes looked on the rich goods after they left the
French capital, where it would be represented, perhaps, that they
had been bought of the Duc-de&mdash;or of Madame some one, after
having been in the possession of royalty, they would buy
freely.</p>
<p>Sevres porcelain fetched high prices then, but it has risen
higher in the market, even since, and has gone on rising to the
present time.&nbsp; In 1850 cups and saucers fetched from
&pound;25 to &pound;30 each, and bowls &pound;66 or
&pound;70.&nbsp; Three oval vases and <a name="page55"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 55</span>covers at Lord Pembroke&rsquo;s sale
fetched &pound;1020.&nbsp; Prices have however since gone up; and
at Mr. Bernal&rsquo;s sale a pair of rose Dubarry vases sold for
1850 guineas; and cups and saucers for &pound;100.&nbsp; Single
plates have since sold for &pound;200; vases for 500 or 600
guineas each, and cups and saucers for 150 guineas.&nbsp; A year
ago a set of three Jardiniers fetched at Christie&rsquo;s, by
auction, &pound;10,000!</p>
<p>We remember seeing an ornament at the Marquis of
Anglesey&rsquo;s at <i>Beau Desert</i> which we were assured was
old Sevres, and had been purchased at a great price on the
continent, but which we recognised as one of our own painting at
Madeley.&nbsp; A man can always tell his own painting; but it is
not an easy matter for another however experienced sometimes to
do so.&nbsp; An amusing instance occurred at Coalport.&nbsp; Mr.
F. W. Rose who had been conversant from a child with china, on
one occasion bought a vase, painted with birds, believing it to
be old Sevres, but which was made at the Coalport Works and
painted by the present writer at Madeley.&nbsp; Mr. Rose, sending
for us down to the office said, &ldquo;here, Randall, is a vase I
have given a good price for, which is the right thing; can you do
anything like it?&rdquo;&nbsp; Our reply was, it would be strange
if we could not, as we did that when a lad, adding that it was
made at his own manufactory, that it was modelled by George
Aston, and purchased out of the warehouse, in the white, by T.
Martin Randall.&nbsp; We need <a name="page56"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 56</span>scarcely say that he was very much
astonished on finding he had been duped by a London china dealer
with a piece of his own ware.&nbsp; It was put out of sight; but
the late Mr. Pugh did not forget occasionally to remind his
partner of the incident.</p>
<p>Mr. Randall removed from Madeley to Shelton, in the Potteries,
for the greater convenience of carrying on his works.&nbsp; He
was invited by the late Herbert Minton to become a partner, and
to make his ware for the benefit of both at his extensive works
at Stoke.&nbsp; Age however, and a longing for retirement led him
to decline, and he soon afterwards retired to a cottage at
Barleston, where he died, and was buried, in a sunny spot of his
own choosing, within sound of the murmuring waters of the
Trent.&nbsp; He was a good man; one holding large and liberal
views, and one who took an active part in various social and
religious movements of the day, being an active promoter more
particularly of Temperance Societies, when first established in
this country.&nbsp; Specimens of his ware are much prized and
sought after by collectors.&nbsp; A fine specimen with torquoise
ground is in the possession of Henry Dickinson Esq.</p>
<p>The chief beauty of Mr. Randall&rsquo;s porcelain, like that
of other fret bodies, or <i>pate tendre</i> china, was that it
admitted of a complete amalgamation of the painting with the
glaze, and also of a richness and depth of colour, as in the case
of torquoise, not to be produced on ordinary china.</p>

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
